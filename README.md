I’m Charles Burbage, a newly graduated programmer. I’m primarily interested in game development, and and web development. 

Currently self-teaching C# with Unity, and Blender in my free time, after being required to take a crashcourse on it for a group project. 

I'm open to working in teams, and I'm usually the one putting a project together at the end to meet deadlines.

You can reach me at charlesburbage.com, my personal website/portfolio.

You can find much of my previous work there; ranging from my earliest programs to my newest projects, you can see my improvement over the last two years.
